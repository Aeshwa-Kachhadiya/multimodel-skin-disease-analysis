# Multi-Modal Skin Disease Analysis Power BI Dashboard
## Project Objective
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze a multi-modal dataset for skin disease diagnosis and intervention planning. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of **disease and death rate trends** (2018â€“2023), identifies **high-risk demographics** by age and gender, and breaks down the **average patient cost** across multiple skin conditions to support data-driven decisions in healthcare resource allocation.
## Key Findings & Insights
Based on the visual analysis, the following are the primary insights:

* **Overall Disease Trend:** The total skin disease rate shows a volatile trend, with notable dips in 2020 and 2022 and a significant peak in 2023, suggesting recent increases in reported cases.
* **Cost Drivers:** Fungal Skin Diseases and Rosacea represent the highest average patient cost, at $491.59K (14.27%) and $478.28K (13.86%) respectively, highlighting them as critical areas for cost efficiency review.
* **Most Affected Demographic:** The 60+ age group shows the highest disease rate across all conditions combined, underscoring the necessity of targeted interventions for older adults.
* **Gender Distribution:** While gender percentages are relatively balanced overall, specific conditions like Rosacea and Psoriasis show a slightly higher rate in one gender versus others, which may warrant further investigation.
* **Mortality Trend:** The death rate per 100K peaked across most skin diseases around 2021 and has generally maintained a high, albeit slightly declining, trend since then.
